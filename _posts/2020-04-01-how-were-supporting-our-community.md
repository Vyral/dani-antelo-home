We want to give back during these uncertain times. If you’ve been directly affected by this pandemic, we would be happy to list your home for free. Here are some of the other things we’re doing to help our clients right now.

We hope you’re staying safe (and sane\!) during this challenging time. We want to support our community, so if you have been directly affected by the coronavirus or the oil and gas downturn, we will list your home for free. We will include a 3D Matterport tour so buyers can virtually walk through your house without stepping foot in it. This is in addition to our regular services which include professional photography and video. We’re looking forward to being able to host traditional open houses again, but in the meantime, please remember you can ask us anything. To hear more about what we’re doing during this peculiar time, watch the video above.&nbsp;
